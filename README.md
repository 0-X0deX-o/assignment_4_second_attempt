COM S 127 - Assignment #4 Grading Rubric
This assignment was assigned on 10-10-2022
This assignment is due by 11:59 p.m. Friday, October the 21st (10-21-2022). It will be considered 'late' if turned in after this 
time. However, there will be a two (2) day 'grace period' extended until 11:59 p.m. Sunday, October the 23rd (10-23-2022). If the 
assignment is turned in after 11:59 p.m. Friday, October the 21st, but before 11:59 p.m. Sunday, October the 23rd, it will suffer 
at 10% 'late penalty' to the grading. The assignment will not be accepted after 11:59 p.m. Sunday, October the 23rd.
Assignment Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to allow students to become more familiar with the use of 'functions.' This assignment will 
require the use of several 'functions,' as well as the application of 'input validation' to player input. The student will be given a 
pre-coded 'start' file, to which they will have to add several new features. This assignment will also require more substantial use 
of logical thinking to complete its objectives than previous assignments.
Instructions
Students should study the file provided, and notice the various 'TODO' comments. These indicate tasks in the file that students 
should complete by typing in their own original code. These 'TODO' comments indicate items in the script which will be 
evaluated for the final grade on the assignment. The file the student submits must be named dungeonCrawl.py.
The various 'TODO' comments can all be found inside the dungeonCrawl.py start file.
Files Provided
Students will have access to the following 'start file,' which will detail all of the TODO tasks:
dungeonCrawl.py

Special Notes
NOTE: This assignment is substantially more difficult than previous assignments.
l Completing this assignment may require the student to start their work 'before the last minute.' Please plan accordingly. 
l The student's script CANNOT crash under any circumstances. Any portions of the student's code where the script crashes 
will receive a zero (0) for that aspect of the game. 
ยก For example, if a student's script crashes during the 'combat' section, the student will not earn the point for
implementing that particular feature. 
l Much of the logic in this assignment is the same as in the previous one. The student should feel free to reuse as much 
previously written code as possible. 
NOTE: Assignments turned in in any other format other than a .py file will not be accepted.
l Screenshots of code will not be accepted. 
l .sln files are not code files - they contain no Python code and will not be accepted. 
l .zip, .rar, .tar.gz, and other compressed files will not be accepted. 
l If a student's submission is not in a .py file, it will not be graded. 
ยก THIS WILL LEAD TO THE STUDENT RECEIVING A ZERO (0) ON THE ASSIGNMENT.
NOTE: Submitting the assignment on Canvas may result in either an error message or a 'spinning blue circle' on the 
submission page. This is the normal/ expected behavior.
l So long as the top of the page reads 'Submitted' in green text, there should not be a problem. 
l The student can email a Graduate TA/ UGTA to confirm the status of their submission. 
Grading Items
l (Due Date AND File Name) Was the assignment turned in by the due date, AND is the file named dungeonCrawl.py?

l (Name In Script AND Delete First TODO AND Name In Output) Has the student typed in their name/ date/ assignment 
number at the top of the dungeonCrawl.py file, AND did the student delete the first 'TODO' comment in
dungeonCrawl.py such that the first thing in the file is their name/ date, AND Has the student added their name/ section 
number to the initial script output?: ______ / 1 
l ("p" Section Tasks) Has the student completed the "p" section tasks?: ______ / 6 
l ("i" Section Tasks) Has the student completed the "i" section tasks?: ______ / 1
